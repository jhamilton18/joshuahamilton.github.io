                    <p class="project-description">This study investigated how social media algorithms (content ranking, recommendation, and infinite scrolling) affect users' cognitive processes, specifically working memory capacity, executive attention, and cognitive load. Participants were exposed to different algorithm conditions and their cognitive performance was measured before and after exposure. While no significant differences were found in working memory or attention, infinite scrolling was associated with increased perceived cognitive load, consistent with previous research on information overload.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">This project aims to create an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to provide personalized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The AI agent, implemented using a language model like ChatGPT, will interact with users in real-time, guiding them through CBT techniques, such as cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy. The VR environment, built using Unreal Engine, will provide a safe and controlled space for users to practice new skills and confront their fears. By combining the strengths of VR and AI, this project seeks to revolutionize mental health care by providing accessible and effective therapy</p>
